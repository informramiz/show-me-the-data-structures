**My Reasoning:**
It is given in the question that you have to use `LinkedList` and also that the way each block points to the previous block fits perfectly with the `LinkedList` data structure.

**Time Complexity:** 
1. Append: `O(1)`
2. Search: `O(n)`
3. Delete: `O(n)`
4. to_list: `O(n)`

**Space Complexity:** Space complexity is `O(n)` which is the number of blocks.
